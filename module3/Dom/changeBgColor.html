        It was a bitter fight for supremacy in Asia. Japan had provoked the US in the Pacific War. 
        The Second World War now spanned the entire globe. 
        The two naval nations competed against each other on the worldâ€™s largest ocean and fought battles on an unprecedented scale.
        In the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, 
        Japanese bombers destroyed most of the American Pacific fleet within hours and killed 2,500 U.S. soldiers. 
        The surprise military strike was intended to help secure Japan's supremacy in the Eastern Pacific. 
        The Pacific War began, which only ended after the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the summer of 1945. 
        The WELT documentary reconstructs its course using mostly color original footage.
